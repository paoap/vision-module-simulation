# vision-module-simulation
This repository contains the Python scripts for simulating the motion and detection of a vision system on a virtual field

This script was used in the study "Simulation-Aided Development of a CNN-Based Vision Module for Plant Detection: Effect of Travel Velocity, Inferencing Speed, and Camera Configurations" published in the Special Issue of Applied Sciences: Remote Sensing Applications and Agricultural Automation.

The published paper is available at: https://doi.org/10.3390/app12031260

## dependencies
The script requires Numpy and Pandas library. It was written and tested in Python 2.7 in Ubuntu 18.04 to utilize ROS Melodic Morenia
